                    <section>
                        Open graph is a protocol used on webpages to
                        enable them to become graph objects and thus share
                        functionality as other related objects.
                        This is achieved by adding basic meta data in the headers
                        of your web pages that are used to relate to your web page

                <h2>Why we separate HTML and CSS</h2>
                <article>
                    <section>
                        The reason for separating HTML and CSS is because it
                        makes the code and content much easier to read and understand
                        whereas if both CSS and HTML were all combined into one along
                        with javascript, it would be very messy and hard to find things.
                        It also limits code duplication and is because of that a more
                        efficient way since you only have to specify things once
                        and then reference them via a tag or it may even be
                        automatic.
                        It also reduces bandwidth usage which is important on lower
                        bandwidth modems or networks such as 56k etc.
                        It also allows for changing layout and style without touching
                        the page content at all.

                <h2>Media Queries</h2>
                <article>
                    <section>
                        A Media Query is a CSS technique which was introduced in CSS3.
                        It uses a rule; "@media" to include/invoke a block of css properties
                        if a certain condition is true. This condition could for example be
                        screen size/resize or say, if the OS is android or iOS.

                <h2>Block or Inline Elements</h2>
                <article>
                    <section>
                        A block level element has a rule to always start on a new line and
                        use the full available width which means that it stretches itself as
                        far right and left as it can.

                    <section>
                        An Inline Element however does not start on a new line and only takes
                        up as much space as needed.
